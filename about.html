          <p class="byline">Posted on 11/19/2012</p>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>For  business managers, &ldquo;the ability to stay connected and be more productive no  matter where they&rdquo; through the use of smartphones enables them to be &ldquo;more  profitable, functional and efficient&rdquo; (Main, 2010).  More, and more businesses are investing in  mobile technology &ldquo;with average  current investments of $422,000 rising to $926,000 in the next year and a half&rdquo;  (Eddy, 2012). Business managers are reaping the rewards of implementing  smartphone technology into their everyday operations as smartphones enable  them to be able to do various activities on the go without having to sit down  at a desktop. For example, &ldquo;a significant percentage [of smartphone users] use  smartphones to check their e-mail (78 percent), view data (53 percent)&rdquo; (Main, 2010).            </p>

          <p class="byline">Posted on 11/19/2012</p>

            <p>With these  benefits, business managers should also be aware of the risks associated with  smartphone use. Because so much sensitive and confidential info are stored in  smartphones, business managers have to find ways to protect that info. Sarah  Vizard points out that only &ldquo;a third [of all  businesses] have a phone finder function activated, and only a fifth use  encryption technology, spam protection or antivirus software.&rdquo; (Vizard, 2012). Another problem  business managers can encounter are employees using smartphones in an  unproductive manner. This may include using social network sites on their  phones for personal use as well as surfing the web for fun. Overall, smartphones bring new light to working on the go but business managers should take  caution with the risks affiliated with them.</p>

          <h2 class="title"><a>Barriers to Adoption</a></h2>
          <p class="byline">Posted on 11/19/2012</p>
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Smartphones are seen almost everywhere in modern businesses but what about those businesses that have not adopted smartphone technology? Smartphones can be very complex and for the older generations that may have grown up without such technology, it can be hard to break the barriers of using smartphones in everyday business. Smartphones are considered a disruptive pieces of technology because they have totally replaced old flip phones and have rendered them obsolete. With that, people have to go through the 5 steps in the &quot;Diffusion of Innovation&quot; model. This model states that one must first gather information about the technology in the &quot;Knowledge&quot; step, then be convinced to use the technology in the &quot;Persuasion&quot; step. Then one must make a choice if they reject or accept the technology in the &quot;Decision&quot; step. If they like it they will start to use it in the &quot;Implementation&quot; step then decide again whether it worked or not in the &quot;Confirmation&quot; step. For many people smartphones have become accepted in everyday use but those that have not adopted the technology prefer an old-school approach to their businesses.</p>
